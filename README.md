# Environment

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Pretraining
- Put the pre-processed and structured pretraining data into the directory `/data/pretrain/` [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html)
  (Pretraining data are acquired and preprocessed by using the scripts from the [TaBERT](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html); We format it as [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) format in consideration of memory usage. 
- Run `sh pretrain.sh`
